        <p>I first met Kevin to discuss the workshops he was going to teach the graduate students at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto (ranked 10th best grad school in Computer Science in the world). I had high expectations, since a friend of mine who had taken several of his courses had been religiously recommending him for at least two years. Kevin attentively asked me what the graduate students hoped to get out of the workshop. As the main point, I listed the ability to give presentations with confidence. Boy did Kevin exceed my already high expectations! Many of the 30 something students who attended the workshop told me that it radically changed their perspectives and increased their self-confidence. A couple even came up to me a year later to talk about how much that workshop meant to them. And every single student handed back a positive review. I cannot recommend Kevin enough.</p>
