        <p>Below is a letter written by Prof. Davood Gozli during his years in graduate school about the impact of Kevin McCormick's empowerment workshops held in HartHouse, University of Toronto.</p>
        <p>Prof. Gozli is now an Assistant Professor in Department of Psychology at the University of Macau.</p>
        <p>Dear Professor Bruce Kidd,
        <p>I am a third-year graduate student at the Psychology department. This is primarily a thank-you letter concerning the creative courses that have been available for us at Hart House (HH) and have been receiving support from the University. With this letter of gratitude, I also would like to give a personal report of some of the experiences that I have gained through taking some of these courses at HH. I strongly believe in the unique potential that these courses have in contributing to the development and learning of our student body. It is also my belief that these courses could be a great source of empowerment and growth for the students across all disciplines.</p>                 
        <p>I joined the University of Toronto in 2010, and after listening to the inspiring welcome speech of Louise Cowin, who was the Warden of HH at the time, I signed up in an introductory acting course called Finding Personal Liberation and Authenticity taught by Mr. Kevin McCormick. This course, I later learned, is part of a bigger scheme designed with the aim of introducing students of science and technology (i.e., fields other than the arts) to the arts as a means to empowerment. Since then, I have taken four other acting courses at HH. These courses have helped me greatly in many of my academic activities, including public speaking and social interactions with my colleagues. More deeply, my awareness of my goals, plans, and passions has improved through the creative courses. I have benefited as a graduate students and I would like to list a few important reasons why other students will similarly benefit from these courses.</p>
        <p>Interdisciplinary communication and collaboration has become an extremely important theme in todayâ€™s world of research. Interestingly, HH is one of the best places where we can meet our counterparts from the other departments. The creative courses provide such an engaged environment that leads, almost necessarily, to forming deep and meaningful connections. Through these conversations I have learned better to listen to researchers in fields unfamiliar to me, and how to describe my own work to them. I have learned also that effective communication is a prime example of creativity.</p>
        <p>Somewhat related to interdisciplinary contact, cross-cultural contact is also a prominent issue in our University. I was born and raised in Iran. And I have lived in Turkey and Malaysia for years before coming to Canada in 2007. As such, I am all too familiar with the invisible boundaries maintained by conflicting cultural assumptions. And, I know of no other force as strong as artistic expression that dissolves these boundaries. I have personally observed other international students who formed deep and lasting connections to their group, when discovering and sharing the liberation that is inherent to a creative moment. After almost three years of being a UofT student, I see HH as a force against alienation and distance between students.</p>
        <p>A third factor, which I believe makes the HH creative courses a significant source of empowerment is due to the fact that it fills an important gap in our formal training. The creative courses are heavily informed by a complex and embodied view of the mind. The type of learning they provide puts a great deal of emphasis on emotions, conflicts, and self-expressions. These components of the lived experience are so ubiquitous, that a lack of familiarity with them can put anyone at a great disadvantage. What we learn in school will be applied within the complexity of real-life situations, where social and emotional components are often salient. Furthermore, what we learn will be applied within the ambiguity of real-life situations, where decisiveness and creativity play important roles. The kind of training that is available for us in HH addresses these issues very directly and very explicitly.</p>
        <p>In short, I believe the presence of Hart House and its creative courses is an amazing addition to the world-class academic training we receive at the University of Toronto. Opportunities like this will ensure that our student body will have a multifaceted education, cultivating leadership qualities, and gain better awareness of themselves and their own creative energy.</p>
        <p>I would like to thank you for taking the time to read my letter.</p>
